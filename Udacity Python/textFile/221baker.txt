THE UNHOLY MAN<

  The  preacher was in  fact a thief who  had stolen the original
manuscript of Hamlet  from an  exhibit on the  Riviera, where  he
also  acquired his tan.
The  preacher disguised the manuscript as
a Bible and had Longworth authenticate it for the Duke, whom  the
preacher  hoped would  buy it.
Longworth, however,  in desperate
need of money, killed the preacher with Hamlet's sword and  stole
the  manuscript.Longworth,
who  does  not  smoke,  planted the
German-made cigarette near the  victim's body to throw  suspicion
from
himself; but  in the  process, he  accidentally dropped his
packet of aspirin.
